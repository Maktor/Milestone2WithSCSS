# BUDGET TRACKER
Welcome to this MERN Application!

This application is developed by NCSU Bootcamp students for their Milestone Project #2

# DEMO
https://milestone-2.vercel.app

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project will help you to manage your expenses and help you budget your spending thought out the day, week, and month. You will have to register to use this application.

# INSTALL
1. Clone this project into your local device or download the zip file.
2. Open the project in your code editor (ex. VSC, Atom.)
3. Open two terminal windows in the project.
4. In the first terminal, navigate to the server folder (cd /server). In the second terminal, navigate to the client folder (cd /client).
5. In both terminals, install all the necessary dependencies (npm install).
6. In the server folder, create a new file. Call it ".env". To connect the app to the database, add this line to the ".env" file: "MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://adminAccess:teddiesRunFast@clustermain.ao2jff7.mongodb.net/tracking?retryWrites=true".
Ready to run!
7. Save all the files and start with the server, run "npm start", then run the same command in the client terminal. BOOM!

# FUTURE
We plan to add more features and better UI/UX for a better experience. Visual charts are also another implementation we are planning to work on.
